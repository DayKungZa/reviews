(Maddy Makes Games, 2018)

It is one of the best 2D platformer I've ever played. Each levels introduced mechanics which are pushed further and further to its limits. The level design are very creative with its movement and mechanics, with many moments that will make you feel 'เกมนี้โคตรล้ํา!. The difficulty is very challenging but fair - requiring creative movements but not too precise while encouraging you to try more, rather than quitting - for the most levels.

The story is mainly about not escaping your other self, but rather accepting yourself. The story is well incorporated in the gameplay and themes with symbolism used multiple times. The music is amazing and motifs are used to emphasize the impact of the story very well. (Also, remixes are groovy af)

# Overall 95/100!!!
